# 🎨 React Practice Projects

A collection of small and basic React projects I built while learning. These help me practice core React concepts like components, props, state, and hooks.

## 📁 Projects

| Project Name   | Description         | Folder Name     |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Color Picker   | A simple color picker using React state | `color-picker` |

_More projects coming soon..._

## 🚀 How to Run a Project
